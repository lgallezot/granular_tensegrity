# granular_tensegrity
For Test 1 (Single unit deformation test): run the test1_test2_test3.gh file and follow the following steps
  1. choose a geometry among Star3, T3 and Icosahedron
  2. pretension (strengths) used for radial and vertical cables were respectively 8 and 11.1 for T3, 19 and 11.1 for Star3, 11.1 and 11.1 for Icosahedron
  3. disable all the SollidPointCollide components
  4. use the Solver component in the first step (not the Bouncy solver)
  5. adjust the plate height for it to be just on top of the unit
  6. you can then choose the load applied on top of the plate by changing the dimensions of the bar
